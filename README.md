# Quick Draw
*Quick Draw* is a reflex-based 2D dueling game developed using **Unreal Engine**, created as part of [*The Ultimate Unreal Engine 2D Game Development Course*](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-2d-course/) on **Udemy**, taught by **Cobra Code**.



## About the Game

In *Quick Draw*, you take on the role of a samurai in a tense showdown against a computer-controlled opponent. The goal is simple but challenging: **strike first to win - but don't draw your sword too early, or you'll be disqualified**.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Two samurais face each other in a standoff.
- Wait for the signal - then **react fast** to attack.
- Attack **too early** or **too late**, and you **lose**.

This project focuses on timing, input response, game flow control, and basic AI behavior using Unreal Engine's Blueprint system.

## Purpose

This is the **first project** in a series of small games built as hands-on practice for learning 2D game development in Unreal Engine through the Udemy course by Cobra Code.

## Built With

- [Unreal Engine 5.2](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
